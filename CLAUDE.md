# CLAUDE.md

Personal dashboard for **VGC Pokemon Champions · Regulation M-A**. Static
site hosted on GitHub Pages, data refreshed weekly from Pikalytics and
PokeAPI.

Live: https://shembree89.github.io/pokedash/

## Tech Stack

React 19 · TypeScript 5 · Vite 7 · Tailwind CSS 4 · React Router 7 (HashRouter) · localStorage for user state · GitHub Actions for weekly data refresh.

## Current Status

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Obj 3 — Match Assistant | Not started | Biggest remaining feature. See [Record 002](docs/records/002-match-assistant-design.md) |
| Real damage calc (`@smogon/calc`) | Open | Currently using a heuristic type × stat × HP model. Stats pipeline (nature + SP → calcStat) is already plumbed so the integration is mostly an adapter |
| Move DB (type + category + power) | Open | Needed for set prediction display, real damage calc, and better autocomplete UX |
| Item DB expansion | Open | Currently derived from meta-sets distributions. Missing obscure competitive items |
| Sprites / images | Open | All text-based. PokeAPI sprite URLs exist; would help recognition on narrow screen |
| Weather / terrain awareness | Open | Flag when opponent team has a weather setter so threat scores adjust |
| Lead analysis | Open | Which 2 of the 4 to send out first. Relevant to match assistant |

## Recent Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| Target format = VGC Champions Reg M-A | Matches user's current game. Doubles + bring-4 fits the match-assistant description exactly |
| Static site on GitHub Pages + GH Actions data refresh | Free, no server, data stays fresh weekly. Switch to serverless only if we outgrow static |
| Pikalytics AI markdown endpoints as primary meta source | `/ai/pokedex/championstournaments` — robots.txt permits AI crawlers explicitly, markdown is stabler than scraping HTML |
| PokeAPI as pokedex source | Complete data (base stats, types, abilities, mega forms incl. Z-A). Runtime fallback via `useDex` handles any species the user adds, cached in localStorage |
| Types relaxed: `MetaSet.nature` and `spSpread` optional | Pikalytics Champions explicitly exposes no SP/nature data. Sets carry moves/item/ability only |
| Threat model uses calculated stats on both sides | Meta mons get a `defaultCompetitiveSpread` (32 HP / 32 off / rest in bulk+Spe) so symmetry holds. Prevents user's spread-optimized team from looking artificially strong vs raw-base meta |
| Limitless scraper deferred | Pikalytics "Featured Teams" sections provide enough tournament team data for Obj 1/2. Revisit if Obj 3 needs more team variety |
| `MonFormFields` shared between slot editor and add-wizard | Removes ~150 lines of duplication. One place to add features (e.g. sprite, calc display) |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev              # Vite dev server
npm run build            # tsc -b + vite build
npm run preview          # serve dist

npm run data:refresh     # Pikalytics + PokeAPI → public/data/*.json
npm run data:refresh:sample  # top-20 only, faster for iteration
npm run data:enrich-megas    # just refresh mega forms
```

Deployment is automatic on push to `main` via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
Data refreshes weekly via `.github/workflows/refresh-data.yml` (Sunday 12:00 UTC) + manual dispatch.

## Architecture

**Data flow.** Weekly scraper reads Pikalytics markdown and PokeAPI, writes normalized JSON to `public/data/`. App loads those on startup via `useData()`. Any species not in the build-time pokedex triggers a runtime PokeAPI fetch through `useDex().ensure()`, cached in localStorage — so user collections aren't limited to the top-50.

**Stats pipeline.** `resolveOwned(mon, dexEntry)` computes effective stats at level 50 using `calcAllStats(base, spSpread, nature)`. The same pipeline applies to meta opponents via `resolveMeta(entry, useMega)` which uses a default competitive spread — both sides symmetric so threat comparisons are apples-to-apples.

**User data.** `collection.ts` and `species-cache.ts` are `useSyncExternalStore` stores backed by localStorage. Teams reference owned pokemon by id; removing a mon prunes it from saved teams automatically.

**Mega handling.** Pokedex entries carry a `megas` array. A mon on the user's team is considered mega if `mon.mega` is true; `resolveOwned` picks the mega form whose `requiredItem` matches the held item (falls back to the first mega). Reg M-A allows one mega per team — `validateTeam` enforces this.

## Next Step

**Start Obj 3 — Match Assistant.** See [Record 002](docs/records/002-match-assistant-design.md) for the planned flow, state model, and iteration plan. Open questions captured there.

Preparatory work (should land before or alongside Obj 3):
1. Wire `@smogon/calc` with an SP→EV adapter — unlocks real damage numbers inside matchup cells (currently heuristic)
2. Add a move database (type + category + base power) — needed for the calc and for displaying opponent's plausible moves with useful metadata
